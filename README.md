**# EMOTION DETECTION USING CNN AND HAAR-CASCADE CLASSIFIER**

Proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for facial emotion detection. There are seven classes of facial emotions,
we test data in real-time using Haar-Cascade Classifier to give the highlight in the round of face. We used the FER2013 database and
we train then create visualizations that the greater value of the epoch, accordingly the mean square error has a small value, however,
the accuracy of the model will be increased.
